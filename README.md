> A tiny color clock screen saver for macOS

Night Shade is a macOS screen saver that converts the current time to an RGB hex
code. It’s heavily inspired by Jack Hughes’s
[The Colour Clock](http://thecolourclock.co.uk). Unlike The Colour Clock, which
requires Flash, Night Shade has no dependencies.
